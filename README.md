To deploy static files for your AirBnB clone Django project, you typically follow these steps:

Configure Django Settings for Static Files:
Make sure your Django project settings are configured to handle static files properly. You need to define the STATIC_URL and STATIC_ROOT settings.

Collect Static Files:
Run the collectstatic management command to gather all static files from your apps and place them into the STATIC_ROOT directory

Serve Static Files:
Configure your web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to serve static files directly. You can configure your web server to serve static files from the STATIC_ROOT directory.For example, in Nginx, you can add a configuration block like this:

Deploy Your Application:
Once you have configured static files handling, deploy your Django application to your server.
Test Static File Serving:
After deployment, ensure that your static files are being served correctly. Visit your website and check if the static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) are loading properly.
